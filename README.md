## 🚀 Project Requirements

### Building the Data Warehouse (Dana Engineering)

#### Objective
Develop a modern data warehouse using SQL Server to consolidate sales data, enabling analytical reporting and informed decision-making.

#### Specifications
- **Data Sources:** Import data from two source system (ERP and CRM) provided as CSV files.
- **Data Quality:** Cleanse and resolve data quality issues prior to analysis.
- **Integration:** Combine both sources into a single, user-friendly data model designed for analytical queries.
- **Scope:** Focuse on the latest dataset only; historization of data is not required.
- **Documentation:** Provide clear documentation of the data model to support both business stakeholders and analytics teams.

### BI: Analytics & Reporting (Data Analytics)

#### Objective
Develop SQL-based analitycs to deliver detailed insights into:
- **Customer Behavior**
- **Product Performance**
- **Sales Trends**

These insights empower stakeholders with key business metrics, enabling strategic decision-making.

## 🚧 Data Architecture

The data architecture for this project follows Medallion Architecture **Bronze**, **Silver** and **Gold** layers:  
<img width="1039" height="636" alt="architecture_dwh" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/543d33bd-a372-4352-97ff-67bdc791486a" />

1. **Bronze Layer:** Stores raw data as-is from the source system. Data is ingested from CSV Files into SQL Server Database.
2. **Silver Layer:** This layer includes data cleansing, standartization, and normalization processes to prepare data for analysis.
3. **Gold Layer:** Houses business-ready data modeled into a star schema required for reporting and analytics.
